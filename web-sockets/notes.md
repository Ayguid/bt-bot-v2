1. Race Conditions in Data Processing
The bot processes data from multiple websockets simultaneously without proper synchronization. This could lead to race conditions where trade decisions are made based on partially updated data.

2. Error Handling Deficiencies

The error handling in websocket connections attempts to reconnect on failure but doesn't implement proper exponential backoff, which could lead to connection spamming.
Several API calls have try-catch blocks but don't implement proper recovery strategies.

3. Risk Management Issues

The stop loss is statically set at 2% below entry price, not accounting for volatility of different pairs.
The position sizing uses a fixed risk percentage (1%) but doesn't adjust for the varying volatility of different trading pairs.

4. Trading Logic Weaknesses

The candle pattern analysis is overly simplistic, only looking at body ratio without considering market context.
The volume analysis doesn't account for normal volume patterns throughout the day.
The combined signal calculation uses arbitrary weights (0.6 and 0.4) without clear justification.

5. Order Execution Problems

In the executeExit function, the quantity calculation doesn't use the proper precision formatting that the buy function uses.
The stop loss order placement doesn't verify if the order was actually placed successfully.

6. Memory Management Issues

The bot stores unlimited candle data without proper garbage collection, which could lead to memory leaks over time.

7. API Call Frequency Limitations

The code doesn't implement rate limiting for API calls, which could lead to IP bans from Binance.

8. Critical Calculation Errors

The calculation for position quantity in executeSell doesn't use the same precision logic as the buy side, likely leading to order rejections.
In the placeStopLossOrder function, there's a potential issue with using a helper function minusPercent that might not be properly defined.

9. Websocket Reconnection Logic
The reconnection strategy doesn't account for Binance's specific websocket behavior and could lead to duplicate connections.
10. Market Data Inconsistency
The bot doesn't verify that the data received via websockets is consistent and up-to-date before making trading decisions.
11. Insufficient Testing for Edge Cases
The simulation logic for test mode doesn't properly mimic all aspects of live trading, potentially leading to surprises when switching to live mode.
12. Trade Exit Strategy
The bot only has three exit conditions (stop loss, take profit, and reversal signal) but lacks trailing stop logic that would be important for scalping strategies.
These issues could significantly impact the bot's performance and reliability in real-world trading scenarios. Before running this in a live environment with real money, these issues should be addressed.
